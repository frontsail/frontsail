   * This sets the target environment for the generated JavaScript code. It
   * tells `esbuild` to transform JavaScript syntax that is too new for these
   * environments into older JavaScript syntax that will work in these
   * environments. For example, the `??` operator was introduced in `Chrome 80`
   * so `esbuild` will convert it into an equivalent (but more verbose)
   * conditional expression when targeting `Chrome 79` or earlier.
   *
   * Note that this is only concerned with syntax features, not APIs. It does
   * not automatically add polyfills for new APIs that are not used by these
   * environments. You will have to explicitly import polyfills for the APIs
   * you need (e.g. by importing `core-js`). Automatic polyfill injection is
   * not available.
   *
   * Each target environment is an environment name followed by a version
   * number. The following environment names are currently supported:
   *
   * - `chrome`
   * - `deno`
   * - `edge`
   * - `firefox`
   * - `hermes`
   * - `ie`
   * - `ios`
   * - `node`
   * - `opera`
   * - `rhino`
   * - `safari`
   *
   * Defaults to `es2020` if platform is set to `browser` and `node16.3.0` if
   * the platform is `node`.
